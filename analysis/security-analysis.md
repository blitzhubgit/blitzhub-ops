## Description
Assessment of vulnerabilities and security measures, with test results (SQLi, XSS) and mitigation outcomes.

## How to Develop
- **Audience**: Security team and stakeholders.
- **Tone**: Technical and formal.
- **Format**: Markdown with test results and recommendations.

## Steps to Build
- Introduce analysis: "Security assessment for BlitzHub."
- List tests: E.g., "SQLi, XSS, DDoS, Trivy scans."
- Detail results: E.g., "Zero critical vulnerabilities; DDoS mitigated in <5 min."
- Include logs: E.g., "Wazuh: 10 XSS attempts blocked."
- Finalize with recommendations: E.g., "Increase WAF rule updates."
