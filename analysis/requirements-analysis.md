## How to Develop
- **Audience**: Project team and stakeholders.
- **Tone**: Analytical and objective.

## Steps to Build
- Introduce analysis: "Validation of BlitzHub requirements."
- List requirements: Functional (e.g., 2 clicks to buy), non-functional (e.g., latency <50ms).
- Detail validation: E.g., "Compared with Pump.fun: BlitzHub 2 clicks vs. 3."
- Include community input: E.g., "Discord feedback: prioritize usability."
- Finalize with findings: E.g., "Requirements align with user needs."
