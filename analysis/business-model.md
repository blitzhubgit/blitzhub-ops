# Business Model for BlitzHub üöÄ

## Overview üìú
BlitzHub is a platform on the Solana blockchain that enables creators to launch and trade tokens, primarily meme coins, with the goal of graduating them to Raydium once they reach a market cap of $69,000. The platform uses a bonding curve to determine token prices during trading, accumulates value in a vault, and creates a liquidity pool (LP) on Raydium upon graduation. The model includes token retention, burning, proportional fee refunds, and aggressive creator incentives to drive participation. The graduation target of $69,000 was chosen for its symbolic significance in the crypto and meme coin community, where the number 69 is a well-known internet meme often associated with humor and virality‚Äîvalues that resonate with the meme coin culture. This number also aligns BlitzHub competitively with platforms like Pump.fun (which uses a 69,000 RAY target, approximately $138,000), while keeping the goal more accessible to creators, fostering more frequent graduations and enhancing the platform's appeal.

## Key Mechanics ‚öôÔ∏è

### Token Creation üõ†Ô∏è
- **Total Supply**: 1 billion (1B) tokens per project.
- **Creation Fee**: 0.01 SOL ($1.50 @ $150/SOL) üí∏
  - Covers network fees: 0.003 SOL ($0.45).
  - Remaining 0.007 SOL ($1.05) converted into tokens for the creator at the initial price ($0.00001/token).
  - 0.007 SOL ($1.05) ‚Üí 105,000 tokens.
- **Network Fees (Solana)**:
  - Paid by the creator as part of the 0.01 SOL fee.
- **Retention**:
  - 1% (10M tokens) retained by the platform for development purposes (no financial interest, not sold).
- **Burning**:
  - 30% (300M tokens) burned before graduation to reduce supply and increase token value üî•.
- **Tokens for LP**:
  - Adjusted based on the price at graduation (see calculations below).
- **Tokens in Circulation**:
  - After retention and burning: 1B - 10M (development) - 300M (burned) = 690M tokens initially, adjusted for LP.

### Trading and Bonding Curve üìà
- **Initial Purchase (Creator Only)**:
  - Creator can buy up to 0.333 SOL ($50) worth of tokens (5M tokens at $0.00001/token) with 0% platform fees, one-time per token creation.
  - Network fees: 0.0005 SOL ($0.075) per transaction (paid by creator).
- **Subsequent Trading**:
  - Tokens are traded using a bonding curve (linear or exponential, not specified).
  - Platform fees: 0%-0.5% (average 0.25%), fully refunded to traders upon graduation.
- **Market Cap Target for Graduation**: $69,000 üéØ.
- **Volume Accumulated in Vault**:
  - Estimated based on a bonding curve ratio (volume:market cap).
  - Base scenario: 3:1 ratio ‚Üí 1,380 SOL ($207,000).

### Graduation to Raydium üåü
- **Liquidity Pool (LP)**:
  - 614 SOL ($92,100) to create the LP on Raydium.
  - LP Structure (50/50 SOL/Token):
    - 307 SOL ($46,050).
    - 634.5M tokens (adjusted based on token price, see below).
- **Slippage**:
  - Order of 66.67 SOL ($10,000): Slippage = (66.67 √∑ 614) √ó 100% = 10.8% üìâ.

### Fee Structure üí∞
- **Platform Fees**:
  - Creation and creator's initial purchase (up to 0.333 SOL): 0%.
  - Subsequent trades: 0%-0.5% (average 0.25%).
  - Fully refunded to traders proportionally (each trader receives exactly what they paid).
- **No Graduation Fees**: Explicitly excluded.

### Expenses üßæ
- **Platform Fee Refunds**:
  - Calculated based on volume accumulated after the creator's initial purchase.
- **Creator Rewards**:
  - Standard: 10 SOL ($1,500).
  - Promotions: 15 SOL ($2,250).
  - Influencers/Teams/Discord Channels: 20 SOL ($3,000).
- **Milestone Reward**:
  - Tokens reaching $100,000 market cap in 24 hours: +2 SOL ($300) üèÜ.
- **Network Fees (Solana)**:
  - **Creation**: 0.003 SOL ($0.45) (paid by creator via 0.01 SOL fee).
  - **Initial Purchase (Creator)**: 0.0005 SOL ($0.075) per transaction (paid by creator).
  - **Creating LP**: 3 transactions √ó 0.001 SOL = 0.003 SOL ($0.45).
  - **Refunding platform fees**: Estimated 100 traders, 1 transaction per trader √ó 0.0005 SOL = 0.05 SOL ($7.50).
  - Total (platform-paid): 0.003 + 0.05 = 0.053 SOL ($7.95).
- **Referral Bonus**:
  - 1 SOL ($150) per referred user, 50% chance ‚Üí 0.5 SOL ($75) per token graduated.

## Financial Calculations (Base Scenario: 3:1 Ratio) üíπ

### Base Assumptions
- **SOL Price**: $150/SOL.
- **Volume Accumulated (Vault)**: 1,380 SOL ($207,000, 3:1 ratio with market cap of $69,000).
- **Creator's Initial Purchase**:
  - 0.333 SOL ($50), included in the 1,380 SOL ($207,000).
- **Platform Fees**:
  - Creator's purchase: 0.333 SOL ($50), 0% fees ‚Üí 0 SOL ($0).
  - Remaining volume: 1,380 SOL ($207,000) - 0.333 SOL ($50) = 1,379.667 SOL ($206,950).
  - Fees collected: 1,379.667 SOL √ó 0.0025 = 3.45 SOL ($517.50).
- **Tokens in Circulation (Pre-LP)**:
  - Total: 1B.
  - Development: 10M.
  - Burned: 300M.
  - Initial circulation: 1B - 10M - 300M = 690M.
- **Price per Token (Pre-LP)**:
  - Market cap: $69,000.
  - Tokens: 690M.
  - Price: $69,000 √∑ 690M = $0.0001.
- **LP Adjustment**:
  - 307 SOL ($46,050) worth of tokens.
  - $46,050 √∑ $0.0001 = 460.5M tokens.
  - Tokens in circulation after LP: 690M - 460.5M = 229.5M.
- **Final Price per Token**:
  - Market cap: $69,000.
  - Tokens: 229.5M.
  - Price: $69,000 √∑ 229.5M = $0.00030065.

## Alignment with Degen Audit ‚úÖ
- **NoMint**: Recommended to disable minting after token creation to prevent dilution.
- **Blacklist**: No blacklist function in the contract (assumed, to be confirmed).
- **Burn**: 30% (300M tokens) burned, aligning with best practices.
- **Top10/Insiders**: Small allocation to creator (105,000 tokens from creation fee), no pre-sales or team allocations, minimizing concentration risks.

| **Volatility Mitigation** | 50% profit in USDC | Partial conversion to USDC |

## Recommendations üìã
- Disable minting in the token contract to align with "NoMint: Yes".
- Consider gradual burning of the 10M development tokens to further reduce supply over time.
