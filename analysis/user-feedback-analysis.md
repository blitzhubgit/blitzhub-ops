# User Feedback Analysis

This analysis compiles feedback from BlitzHub users to identify areas for improvement.

## Purpose
Enhance user experience based on real feedback from testing phases.

## Methodology
- Conducted usability tests with 10 users (creators/traders).
- Collected feedback via surveys and community channels (Discord, Telegram).

## Feedback
- **Positive**:
  - "Creating a token was easy, only 3 clicks!" (90% satisfaction).
  - "Love the TradingView chart on the token detail page."
- **Suggestions**:
  - "Add more curve options for token creation."
  - "Chat could support emojis and images."
- **Issues**:
  - "Cooldown (10s) feels too long for active trading."

## Recommendations
- Add new curve types (e.g., logarithmic).
- Enhance chat with multimedia support.
- Reduce cooldown to 5s for high-priority trades.

## Conclusion
Feedback highlights BlitzHubâ€™s strengths in usability but identifies areas for improvement.
