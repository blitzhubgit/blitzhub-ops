# Performance Analysis Description

## Description
Evaluation of system performance to ensure SLOs are met (e.g., latency <50ms).

## How to Develop
- **Audience**: Technical team and stakeholders.
- **Tone**: Technical and data-driven.
- **Format**: Markdown with test results and metrics.

## Steps to Build
- Introduce analysis: "Performance evaluation for BlitzHub."
- List tests: E.g., "Simulate 65,000 req/s, 16,000 users."
- Detail results: E.g., "APIs: <50ms, Charts: <50ms, Errors: <0.1%."
- Include regional data: E.g., "SA-FE-01 vs. NA-FE-01 latency comparison."
- Finalize with conclusion: E.g., "System meets SLOs."
