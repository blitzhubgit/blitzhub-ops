# Community Guidelines

The BlitzHub community guidelines ensure a safe and respectful environment for all users interacting on platforms like Telegram, Discord, and the in-platform chat (e.g., on the token detail page).

## Purpose
Define expectations for user behavior to prevent spam, harassment, or misinformation, especially in community chats.

## Guidelines
- **Respect**: No harassment, hate speech, or offensive language.
- **No Spam**: Avoid repetitive messages or unsolicited promotions.
- **Accuracy**: Do not spread misinformation about tokens (e.g., false claims about MoonCoin).
- **Chat Etiquette**: Use the token detail page chat for relevant discussions (e.g., "Has anyone bought MoonCoin?").

## Enforcement
- Moderators may warn or ban users violating guidelines.
- Appeals can be sent to `contact@klytic.com`.

## Contact
For questions, reach out via Telegram or Discord.
