# Token Creation Best Practices

This guide helps BlitzHub users create high-quality tokens, ensuring better engagement and reducing errors.

## Purpose
Provide recommendations for creating tokens (e.g., choosing curves, writing descriptions) to improve user experience.

## Best Practices
- **Name and Symbol**: Use clear, unique names (e.g., "MoonCoin", "MOON"), max 64 and 32 characters.
- **Curve Selection**: Choose wisely:
  - Linear: Steady growth.
  - Quadratic: Faster early growth.
  - Exponential: High-risk, high-reward.
- **Description**: Be concise and informative (max 128 characters, e.g., "A meme coin to conquer the moon!").
- **Image**: Use high-quality PNG/JPG (max 5 MB), avoid copyrighted content.
- **Links**: Add valid social links (Twitter, Telegram) to build trust.

## Tips
- Test on Devnet first to avoid wasting SOL.
- Check token details page after creation for accuracy.
