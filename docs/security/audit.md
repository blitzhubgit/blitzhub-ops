# Audit Description

## Description
Security audit reports, with test results (SQLi, XSS), Wazuh logs, and Trivy scans.

## How to Develop
- **Audience**: Security team and stakeholders.
- **Tone**: Technical and formal.
- **Format**: Markdown with tables and results.

## Steps to Build
- Introduce audit: "Security audit results for BlitzHub."
- List tests: E.g., "SQLi, XSS, DDoS, Trivy scans."
- Record results: E.g., "Trivy: zero critical vulnerabilities in `blitzhub:latest`."
- Include logs: E.g., "Wazuh: 10 XSS attempts blocked."
- Finalize with recommendations: E.g., "Increase Trivy scan frequency."
