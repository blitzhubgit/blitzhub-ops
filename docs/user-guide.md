## Graduation to Raydium üåü

Once a token reaches a market cap of $69,000, it automatically graduates to Raydium, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Solana. Here's what happens:

- **Automatic Process**:
  - The BlitzHub smart contract monitors the token's market cap.
  - Upon reaching $69,000, a liquidity pool (LP) is created on Raydium with 614 SOL ($92,100) and 634.5M tokens.
  - The LP is structured as 50/50 (SOL/Token): 307 SOL ($46,050) and tokens worth $46,050.
  - Slippage for a $10,000 order is approximately 10.8%, ensuring decent liquidity for trading.
- **Notification**:
  - You will receive a notification in the BlitzHub interface with a link to the Raydium pool (e.g., `https://raydium.io/liquidity/?pool=<pool_address>`).
  - You can start trading your token on Raydium immediately.
- **Platform Fees Refund**:
  - All platform fees (0%-0.5%) paid during trading are refunded proportionally to traders upon graduation.

## Post-Graduation Visibility üìà

After graduating to Raydium, your token will be automatically listed on some platforms, while others require manual action to increase visibility. Follow these steps to maximize exposure:

- **Automatic Listings**:
  - **Jupiter**: Your token will be detected by Jupiter (a Solana aggregator) within hours of the Raydium listing, as the liquidity pool meets Jupiter's criteria (price impact &lt; 30% for a $500 swap). You will be notified when the token is available on `jup.ag`.
  - **DexScreener**: DexScreener will automatically detect your token and display its charts and data within a few hours. You will be notified when the token is available on `dexscreener.com/solana/<token_mint>`.
- **Manual Actions (Recommended)**:
  - **Verify on Jupiter**:
    - To remove the warning label ("‚ö†Ô∏è") and increase trust, submit your token for verification at catdetlist.jup.ag.
    - Provide details like the token mint address, project website, and social links.
  - **Submit to CoinGecko**:
    - To list your token on CoinGecko (a major crypto tracking platform), submit a request at coingecko.com/en/coins/new.
    - Provide the token mint address, proof of liquidity (Raydium pool link), and project details (website, socials).
    - Once approved, you will be notified, and your token will be available on `coingecko.com`.
- **Why It Matters**:
  - Listing on Jupiter, DexScreener, and CoinGecko increases your token's visibility, attracting more traders and investors.
  - Verified listings on Jupiter and CoinGecko enhance trust and credibility.
