## Description
SLO metrics (latency, uptime, error rate) and performance monitoring details.

## How to Develop
- **Audience**: Operations team and stakeholders.
- **Tone**: Technical and data-driven.
- **Format**: Markdown with tables and metric examples.

## Steps to Build
- Introduce metrics: "SLO metrics for BlitzHub performance."
- List SLOs: E.g., "Latency: <50ms, Uptime: 99.9%, Error: <0.1%."
- Detail monitoring: E.g., "Prometheus: `http_request_duration_seconds`."
- Include dashboards: E.g., "Grafana: ‘Taxas’, ‘Prioridades’."
- Finalize with examples: E.g., "Achieved: 65,000 req/s, 35,000 tx/hour."
