# Whitepaper Description

## Description
The whitepaper presents an overview of BlitzHub, covering the problem (barriers in token creation), the solution (a user-friendly platform with transparency), tokenomics (fees, refunds, rewards), technology (Solana, React, TradingView), roadmap, team (Klytic), and risks.

## How to Develop
- **Audience**: Investors, users, and the Web3 community.
- **Tone**: Professional yet accessible, avoiding overly technical jargon.
- **Format**: Markdown with clear sections, tables (e.g., fees), and simple diagrams (e.g., purchase flow).

## Steps to Build
- Write the introduction: Explain the problem (e.g., "Token creation is complex and lacks transparency") and BlitzHubâ€™s mission.
- Detail the solution: Describe the platform (creation in 3 clicks, purchase in 2, transparency with fee breakdowns).
- Include tokenomics: Create tables for fees (0%, 0.25%, 0.5%), refunds (100% on graduation), and rewards (2 SOL standard).
- List technologies: Highlight Solana, React, TradingView, and advantages (e.g., latency <50ms).
- Create the roadmap: Use the defined phases (e.g., Fase 1: Planning, Fase 8: Launch).
- Present the team: Introduce Klytic as the solo developer with a brief background.
- Identify risks: Discuss SOL volatility, regulatory risks, and mitigation (e.g., risk warnings in frontend).
- Finalize with a conclusion: Summarize benefits for the Web3 community.
