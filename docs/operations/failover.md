# Failover Description

## Description
Procedures for failover in case of failures (e.g., redirect EU-FE-01 to E2.1.Micro), with Ansible commands and validations.

## How to Develop
- **Audience**: Operations team.
- **Tone**: Technical and direct.
- **Format**: Markdown with numbered steps and commands.

## Steps to Build
- Introduce failover: "Procedures for server failures."
- List scenarios: E.g., "A1.Flex failure in EU-FE-01."
- Detail steps: E.g., "Run `ansible-playbook failover.yml -i inventory/eu-fe-01`."
- Include validations: E.g., "Check `http_requests_total{instance=\"EU-FE-E2-01\"} > 0`."
- Finalize with recovery: E.g., "Restore weights with `ansible-playbook restore.yml`."
