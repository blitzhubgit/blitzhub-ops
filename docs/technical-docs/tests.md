## Description
Documentation of test cases (unit, integration, load), tools (Jest, Vitest, Mocha), and results (e.g., 65,000 req/s).

## How to Develop
- **Audience**: Developers and testers.
- **Tone**: Technical, focusing on reproducibility.
- **Format**: Markdown with tables and test examples.

## Steps to Build
- Introduce tests: "Tests ensure BlitzHubâ€™s stability."
- List tools: Jest, Vitest, Mocha, Chai.
- Detail cases: Unit (e.g., validate fees), integration (e.g., purchase with Phantom), load (65,000 req/s).
- Include examples: E.g., `test('calculates Standard fee', () => {...})`.
- Record results: E.g., ">85% coverage, latency <50ms."
