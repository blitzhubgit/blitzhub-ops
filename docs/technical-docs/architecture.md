# Architecture Description

## Description
Overview of BlitzHubâ€™s architecture, including flow diagrams (e.g., purchase flow in Mermaid), component descriptions (frontend, backend, Solana), and inter-relations (e.g., Redis for caching).

## How to Develop
- **Audience**: Developers and technical teams.
- **Tone**: Technical, focusing on clarity and precision.
- **Format**: Markdown with Mermaid diagrams and detailed explanations.

## Steps to Build
- Introduce the architecture: "BlitzHub consists of frontend, backend, and Solana nodes."
- List components: Frontend (React, EU-FE-01), Backend (Fastify, EU-BE-01), Solana (EU-SOL-01).
- Describe inter-relations: E.g., "Frontend calls `/api/buy`, which queues a transaction in RabbitMQ."
- Add diagrams: Use existing flows (e.g., purchase, graduation) in Mermaid.
- Explain dependencies: Redis (cache), Cloudflare (CDN), Vault (keys).
